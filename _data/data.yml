    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am currently a software engineer at Rufus Labs, developing the next generation wearable technologies and productivity platform for smart warehousing and supply chain.

      Before joining Rufus Labs, I received my PhD degree in computer science from University of Southern California, advised by Prof. Barry Boehm. My primary research work at USC is automated transaction analysis of software systems and applications. Before my PhD study, I obtained my MS degree from University of Southern California and my BS degree from Changchun University, both in computer science.
